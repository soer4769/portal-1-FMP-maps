# portal 1 First-Map-Pack (FMP) maps

This is the maps and files used in creating my portal 1 First-Map-Pack (FMP) collection and portal 1 First-Map-Pack background maps (FMP BG), which is the first couple of maps i created and released back in late 2013 to early 2014.

To get it set up correctly for editing and play you need to place the downloaded files in the game's maps folder, which follow the path "\portal\maps\" to the main folder of the game. This is located here to if you it installed in the steam main directory or on a seperate drive (D:\ in this example):

- C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Portal\
- D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Portal\

Thereafter place the prefab folder within the bin folder in the main directory, which is where you also can open the map (.VMF) files with use of Valve's Hammer Editor, named hammer.exe
