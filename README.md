# portal 1 First-Map-Pack (FMP) maps

This is the maps and files used in creating my portal 1 First-Map-Pack (FMP) collection and portal 1 First-Map-Pack background maps (FMP BG), which is the first couple of maps i created and released back in late 2013 to early 2014.

To get it set up correctly for editing and play you need to place the downloaded files in the game's maps folder, which is as follows for if you have installed the game in your main steam folder or on a seperate drive (D:\ in this example):

- C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Portal\portal\maps\
- D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Portal\portal\maps\

You can open the map (.VMF) files with use of Valve's Hammer Editor that is located in the game's main directory's bin folder, named hammer.exe.

Download the playable BSP version of the maps (and the background maps) here with instructions included for how to set it up:
