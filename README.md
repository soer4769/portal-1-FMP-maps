# portal 1 First-Map-Pack (FMP) maps

This is the maps and files used in creating my portal 1 First-Map-Pack (FMP) collection and portal 1 First-Map-Pack background maps (FMP BG), which is the first couple of maps i created and released back in late 2013 to early 2014.

To get it set up correctly for editing and play you need to place the downloaded files in the game's maps folder, which follow the path "\portal\maps\" to the main folder of the game. This can be located in different places to if you it installed in the steam main directory or on a seperate drive (D:\ in this example):

- C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Portal\
- D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Portal\

Read the associated readme file for the background maps if there should be an interest in knowing how to set those up for non-editing purposes.

Download the playable BSP version of the maps (and the background maps) here:
