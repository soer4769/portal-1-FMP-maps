# Compiled maps background setup
All the following steps are required to get the backgrounds maps to work correctly and takes place from within of the game's main directory

- 1. Place the console folder into the materials and materialsrc folders (create them if they do not exists)
- 2. Place the "chapterbackgrounds.txt" file in the script folder and create a backup of the original
- 3. Place the "autoexec.cfg" in the cfg folder (the preferred background map that will be shown can be changed here)
